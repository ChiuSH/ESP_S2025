notes:

    PTM
        modifies protein function
            functions include signaling, localization, degredation
            expands functionality
    model annotates on multi amino acid squence instead of single
    use related PTM to improve prediction due to similar features

notes:

    sequence data more important that structural data for cross talk
    rao et al paper using logistic regression
    cross talk more often on surface of protein and in coils

notes:

    PTM often found in transcription factors and histones
    PTM in areas that have changing sequences, not conserved
    many papers focus on sequence and secondary structure, add tertiary structure to improve model?

methods used:

-SVM, random forest, RNN,CNN, transformer, elastic network model, gaussian network model, anisotropic network model

Data:

-sequence

-crosstalk

-surface vs inner

    data challenges
        data imbalance
            more positive than negative data points
            randomly generate data by random duplication or removal... bootstrapping?
            down side, overfitted but more specific and longer to train if generating
            lose info if removing
