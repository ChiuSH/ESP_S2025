Post-translational modifications (PTMs) refer to the attachment of molecules (e.g., phosphates, sulfates, glycans, ubiquitins, etc.) to amino acids in proteins. These modifications change the properties of the protein and play a large role in protein function, regulation, and cell signaling. PTMs also play a role in disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease via Tau hyperphosphorylation, Huntington's disease via hypopalmitoylation of huntingtin protein, and type 2 diabetes mellitus via malonylation of enzymes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism); therefore, understanding PTMs and locating these modifications can provide valuable targets for therapeutics. However, discovery of PTMs and their locations on proteins is very time consuming, laborious, and expensive. Computational methods, such as machine learning, are required to  alleviate these challenges. Logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors are some traditional machine learning methods that were used with good success in predicting PTMs. As machine learning and AI have advanced tremendously in the last few years, advanced machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural networks(CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer Models, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been used and outperformed traditional machine learning methods. This work will explore the use of a CNN to predict phosphorylation sites using the Pytorch package in Python and data from UniProt. Structural data, attention heads, PTM crosstalk, and bootstrapping will be considered in future work to improve the model.
